So I currently do all my web development work on a windows machine. Both at home and at work.

Here are the tools and apps I use on a day to day basis.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Hands down the best text editor available. There are monthly updates with a huge amount of new features. There is a huge library of extensions with new ones all the time. I'll be writing a posts on setting up VS Code with extensions and some tips soon.

[Cmder](http://cmder.net/) - Terminal for Windows.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

[Trello](https://trello.com/) - I use Trello as a massive to-do list, including notes etc for any projects I'm working on.

[Evernote](https://evernote.com/) - Longer notes storage, draft blog posts.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - I use Hugo as my blog engine. It's super quick and easy to use, and it uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) which is great.

### Tools at work

[Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) - We do mostly [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/) at work and Visual Studio is easily the best IDE I've ever used.

[Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) - A great refactoring tool.

[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - Git GUI tool. Great for interacting with large codebases with lots of collaborators.
