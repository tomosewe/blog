I've been wanting a digital version of resume online for a while now. Recently I came across jsonresume.org which proposes that we should set write our resume in a json file. This allows for a standard and also a way to standardise templates to easily swap between them.

First let's get our react app setup

Go to https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

npx create-react-app my-resume
cd my-resume
npm start

remove the rubbish we don't care about.
push to new git repo

setup netlify to serve git repo

setup the json file

grab basic template and paste into app.js

react all the things
