+++

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator that claims to be the world's fastest framework for building websites. I've used [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in the past to set up a quick blog but found it clunky to use and the build time to be quite slow. So far Hugo has been really easy to set up. (apart from a few issues getting Hugo installed on Ubuntu correctly) I'm loving the huge amount of themes to choose from and switch between. 

Deploying a new Hugo site is also really easy. In the past I've used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and also [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting. However this time I've decided to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as I've heard quite a lot of great things about it. There are heaps of great tutorials I've found for deploying a Hugo site to Netlify.

The first time I deployed to Netlify I just used the in built wizard. It was super simple, all it required was for me choose the GitHub repository for this project and that was it.
