As a developer, you can never stop learning. The web development industry is constantly moving and changing. One week npm is the new hotness, the next yarn is taking over. Angular used to be the go to single page apps, now React or even Vue has taken over.

It's hard to keep up with everything new that comes out. Especially if at your day job you're still using the same stack as was used to build the original app years ago. 

So how do I stay on top of all things new and exciting? Well, I don't. For me it just isn't worth the time and hassle of trying to find out what's going to be the next big thing. Rather I prefer to see what's been building traction over the last year or two. If a tool or framework has managed to attract more people to adopt if for their own projects, and people continue to use it over time, that's when I will get interested and check it out.

For 2018, what's looking interesting to me is React, NodeJs, .Net Core, Firebase, Netlify, and AWS.

I've found the best way to learn something new is to just jump right in and try to build something with it. Over the christmas break I had a play around with React using create-react-app, after a few toy apps, I quickly threw together the splash page for [tomosewe.com](https://tomosewe.com) using React and deploying it to GitHub pages.

I'm really enjoying using React and create-react-app has made it really easy to get set up and deploy a new React app quickly. 

This blog has been setup with Hugo and deployed to Netlify. 

Also getting the dns working for this site and the splashpage has been a real learning experience.

I hope to continue learning and growing this next year.
